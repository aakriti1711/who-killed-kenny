You are NOT allowed to use JavaScript to complete this.If you cannot find a solution using only HTML and CSS,
then use JavaScript.
You should use the image sprite provided to display each image and they should appear in the order shown

Part 2
Add a title and some directions to the page.
Build functionality that will allow you change the sort order of the images.
Clicking on an image will move it into the section below and display the images in the new sort order.
You may use JavaScript for this.
In figure 2a, Kenny, Cartman, Ike and Tweek have been clicked on, in that order.
